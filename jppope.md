Hi, I'm JonPaul Uritis / @jppope/ jonpauluritis.com

Here's a handy guideline for our "quick vetting process" for developers when looking at them for employment=>
________________

##Education

This is University, College, and or training experiences (like bootcamps)... For developers this is obviously only a part of the consideration. But it certainly helps to see that someone could hack it through math at a major university for a while.

##Work experience- companies, positions, duties, projects

Lots of developers will only want to put in their experience that is specific to the job that they are looking at. That would be a mistake. Don't throw the kitchen sink in, but if you have work experience that shows off major skills (soft or hard)


## Freelance experience - companies, stars, etc

If you have any major projects that you are proud of Include them...and explain them. Remember its better to have 3 amazing portfolio projects than it is to have 10 mediocre ones.

##Certs

Sign up for some certifications ... some of them are even free. MongoDB is a $40 course and that certification can be worth an extra $20K in salary

##Mentors

(this is highly controversial) I like to mention who my code mentors are... the reason being: for certain parts of your learning curve you need feed back... and you need it fast. Thus having mentors is super important. 

##Github repositories, stars, followers

Make your github look like its part of your resume. 

##Linkedin Profile

For better or worse a linkedin profile is pretty much a resume now.

##stack overflow points

Some people do github, some do other activities to get them good... if you spend a lot of time sorting out other peoples problems... show it off

##Training programs (treehouse, lynda, codecademy)

This will look like an amateur if you've been developing for a while and you have this on there... but if you are chasing junior dev spots. Showing the extra work that you've completed can look good

##Groups youâ€™ve been a part of

If you are active in meetup groups show it off. Even better if you organize

##Personal Site or Blog

if its worth while... maybe draw attention to your personal site

##Social coding => dribble, codepen, etc

If you like to write diddys on codepen and you have cool stuff let people look at it!

Aline Lerner (http://alinelerner.com/) did a study and found out that the most indicative item of future success was errors on a resume. Spend a little bit of time more than you would normally think to on that resume. A resume is the only "across-the-board" standard in an application process. 

Put comments in your code if you expect people to look at it. Developers like to nitpick, if you can forewarn them about decisions that you made and why it can go a long way. Clients will never look at your code, so making a comment that explains that the ugly cat picture of a logo was not your choice
